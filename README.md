# Word Search Generator

This is a (naive) word search generator written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org).
It exists mostly as playground for my attempts to learn Elm and how to structure
an Elm program.

The easiest way to work on it is to use [elm-reactor](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor). Start it up and browse
to `static/index.html`.
